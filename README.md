# Project Name: Airline Delay Storytelling

----
# Project Objective: Problem Statement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original dataset was purposed for predicting whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure. My analysis on the dataset however was focused on answering the following questions: <br>
i. What has been the history of flight experiences in the past? <br>
ii. How bad was delayed flights? <br>
iii. Any identified pattern with delayed flights? <br>
iv. Which Airline experienced more delay? <br>
v. Which Airline experienced the least dalay? <br>

# Data Sourcing
  The data in the analysis was sourced from a Github Repository using this link: https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students

# Data  Transformation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sourcing the data from the Github Repository, I found out that the dataset had a column with week day names in numbers which in that format would be difficult for analysis. Firstly, I took the step to import the data into MS-Excel and did convert the week days format to date. Secondly, I imported the dataset into Power BI and did transform the new date by deriving the days of the week name in a new column from the power query editor. Finally, I added a new column to show the speed of each Airline within the power query editor.

# Findings
a. Flight experiences in the past <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the analysis, it is evident that numerous airline corporations were in operation such as the Endeavor airlines (9E), the American airlines (AA), the Alaska airlines (AS), the JetBlue Alrways Corporation (B6), the Continental airlines (CO) and many more within the space of a week. Within the week, a total number of 539,383 airplanes had moved from one airport to another. This shows that each airline corporation were actively functioning in the past days within the week. <br>
b. State of delayed flight <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the data analyzed, the analysis revealed that a total of 240,119 of the 539,383 airplanes that operated during the week were delayed, having a rate of 80.3% of total airplanes delayed. It is clear from this angle that the rate of delay is alarming. <br>
c. Pattern in delayed flights <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most delayed airlines seemed to have ocurred more and frequently on wednesday with a record of 25,817 airplanes delayed. <br>
d. Airline with the highest delay experience <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Southwest Airlines with the airline code (WN) had the highest flight delay with a total of 65,657 airplanes delayed. <br>
e. Airline with the least delay <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hawalian Airlines with the airline code (HA) had the least flight delay with a total of 1,786 airplanes delayed.

# Recommendation
1. From the dataset, no departure and arrival time was given, but one can easily decode from the analysis that most delayed flight ocurred more on wednesday, I would advise that more attension and assessment be given to all airlines that would be operating henceforth on Wednesday. The assessment could be in terms of ensuring that the weather before that day is accurately forecasted, placing highly skilled expert pilot to handle each flight e.t.c as this tends to improve flight operations and thus reducing flight delay.
2. The  Southwest Airlines (WN) should pay more attension to their operations as the high rate of flight delays in their engagement could be as a result of aircraft arriving late, national aviation system delay(NAS), air carrier delay as a result of crew, baggage loading or maintenance problems, extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes or bizzards and security-related delays. To overcome this factor, they can modify schedule departure time so as to re-allocate the existing slack in the flight schedule, they should ensure that baggage loading and maintenance are handled more effectively and efficiently etc. The Hawalian Airlines (HA) can also be more better in its operation by improving on those areas also listed for the Southwest Airlines (WN).
